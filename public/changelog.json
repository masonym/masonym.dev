I don&#39;t really know all the nuances of Erda Link and I am too lazy to create a custom solution for her ðŸ’€</li>\n<li>Ren/Len: Added to the list of available classes. Will likely need to change many of the names when they get localized to GMS.</li>\n<li>General: Ascent skills for all classes have been added. This may need to be localized as well. For classes without an ascent skill (non-KMS classes), the space where it would appear will be blank.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fixes:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>There were a few broken M3/M4 images that I never noticed - these are now fixed.</li>\n<li>The origin upgrade cost table was wrong and over-counting Sol Erda (not fragments) for the level 1 -&gt; 2 upgrade.</li>\n</ul>\n"
