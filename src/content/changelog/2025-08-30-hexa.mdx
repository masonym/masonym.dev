summary: "Fixed some broken m3/m4 images, added Sia Astelle (kind of!), Len, and Ascent Skills"

## What Changed 

- Sia Astelle: Added to the list of available classes for the current skills she has. I don't really know all the nuances of Erda Link and I am too lazy to create a custom solution for her ğŸ’€
- Ren/Len: Added to the list of available classes. Will likely need to change many of the names when they get localized to GMS.
- General: Ascent skills for all classes have been added. This may need to be localized as well. For classes without an ascent skill (non-KMS classes), the space where it would appear will be blank.

## Fixes:

- There were a few broken M3/M4 images that I never noticed - these are now fixed.
- The origin upgrade cost table was wrong and over-counting Sol Erda (not fragments) for the level 1 -> 2 upgrade.
